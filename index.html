Q: (Assuming a set has all positive values) If the largest value of a data set is
doubled, which of the following is not true?

a.) The mean increases. TRUE
b.) The standard deviation increases. TRUE
c.) The interquartile range increases. FALSE
d.) The range increases. TRUE

Q: What does it mean if the correlation coefficient, r, is close to 1 or 0?

A: r close to 1 means that X and Y have strong positive linear relationship. r close to −1 means that
X and Y have strong negative linear relationship. r close to 0 means that X and Y have almost no linear
relationship.

Q: In the regression equation y = b0 + b1x, identify what b0 and b1 represent.
Which of these will best explain the relationship between x and y?

A: b0 is the y-intercept and b1 is the slope of the regression line. b1 best explains the relationship
between x and y.

Q: The following table displays the results of a sample of 100 in which the
subjects indicated their favorite ice cream of three listed. The data are organized
by favorite ice cream and age group. What is the probability that a person chosen
at random will be over 40 if he or she favors chocolate?

Age      Chocolate Vanilla Strawberry
40+        15        8        7
20 – 40    20        11       15
>20         8        7        9

A: P(flavor chocolate) = 15 + 20 + 8 / 100 = 43/100,
P(over 40 and flavor chocolate) = 15 / 100,
P(over 40 | flavor chocolate) = P(over 40 and favor chocolate)/P(favor chocolate)=15/43

Q: A random variable X has a probability distribution as follows: Find the probability that P(X < 2)
   X     0  1  2  3
   P(X) 4k 5k 8k 3k

A: First, find k. 4k + 5k + 8k + 3k = 1 → k = 1/20
   Then, P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20

Q: The amount of time it takes a bat to eat a frog was recorded for each bat in
a random sample of 12 bats. The resulting sample mean and standard deviation
were 21.9 minutes and 7.7 minutes, respectively. Assuming it is reasonable to
believe that the population distribution of bat mealtimes of frogs is approximately
normal.

a.) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean time for a bat to eat a frog
    A:  From the question, x¯ = 21.9, s = 7.7, n = 12, C = 0.95, α = 0.05. Since the population standard
deviation is unknown, t-interval should be used. The 100C% confidence interval for population mean is
21.9 + c(-1,1) * qt(1.95/2, 12-1) * 7.7/sqrt(12)

b.) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the variance of the time for a bat to
eat a frog
    A: ll=(12-1)*7.7ˆ2/qchisq(1.95/2,12-1)
       ul=(12-1)*7.7ˆ2/qchisq(0.05/2,12-1)
       c(ll,ul)

Q: Suppose that the average weekly grocery bill for a family of four is $140
with a standard deviation of $10. If the next 52 weeks can be viewed as a random
sample from a population with this center and spread, then the approximate
probability that the total grocery bill for one year is less than $7020 is 0.0002.
This problem can also be solved using the sampling distribution of the sample
average. Complete probability statement. P(Z < _____)

A:  The weekly grocery bill X ∼ N(140, 10) and the 52-week average X¯ ∼ N(140, √10/52).
    P(Z < (7020/52) - 140 / 10/√52

Q: One of your peers claims that boys do better in math classes than girls.
Together you run two independent simple random samples and calculate the
given summary statistics of the boys and the girls for comparable math classes.
In Calculus, 15 boys had a mean percentage of 82.3 with standard deviation of 5.6
while 12 girls had a mean percentage of 81.2 with standard deviation of 6.7. Which
of the following would be the most appropriate test for establishing whether boys
do better in math classes than girls

A: The scores of boys and girls are not dependent and population standard deviations are unknown for
the scores of boys and girls. Therefore, we use two-sample t-test for means.

Q: Rainwater was collected in water collectors at thirty different sites near
an industrial basin and the amount of acidity (pH level) was measured. The
mean and standard deviation of the values are 4.60 and 1.10, respectively. When
the pH meter was recalibrated back at the laboratory, it was found to be in
error. The error can be corrected by adding 0.1 pH units to all of the values and
then multiply the result by 1.2. Find the mean and standard deviation of the
corrected pH measurements

A: E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b, sd(aX + b) = a · sd(X).
   E[1.2(X+0.1)] = 1.2×E[X]+1.2×0.1 = 1.2×4.6+1.2×0.1 = 5.64, sd(1.2(X+0.1)) = 1.2·sd(X) = 1.2×1.1 = 1.32.

Q: What is the expected value and the variance of the discrete probability
function given in the table below?

A: x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
   p = c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.3,0,0.1)
   EX = sum(x*p); EX

   EX2 = sum(xˆ2*p)
   VarX = EX2 - (EX)ˆ2; VarX

Q: The following is a stem-plot of the birth weights of male babies born to
the smoking group. The stems are in units of kg
Stems | Leaves
2       3,4,6,7,7,8,8,8,9
3       2,2,3,4,6,7,8,9
4       1,2,2,3,4
5       3,5,5,6

A: Find the median birth weight. Describe the shape of the distribution
   n = 26, median = x13+x14/2 = 3.4+3.6/2 = 3.5kg, skewed right

Q: A sample of 100 engineers in a large consulting firm indicated that the
mean amount of time they spend reading for pleasure each week is 1.4 hours.
Three interns independently calculate different two-sided confidence intervals
of the true mean amount of time for all of the engineers in the company. The
confidence intervals of the interns were: A) (.17, 2.63) B) (.554, 2.446) C) (1.167, 1.633)

A: For any reasonable confidence interval of population mean, the point estimate, i.e., sample mean
should be the center of the confidence interval and “center = sample mean = lower limit + upper limit/2
”. The center of A) and C) is 1.4, but the center of B) is 1.5 ̸= 1.4

Q: It has been estimated that as many as 70% of the fish caught in certain
areas of the Great Lakes have liver cancer due to the pollutants present. Find an
approximate 95% range for the percentage of fish with liver cancer present in a
sample of 130 fish.

A: qnorm(0.025,0.7,0.0402)
   qnorm(1-0.025,0.7,0.0402)

Q: In a recent publication, it was reported that the average highway gas
mileage of tested models of a new car was 33.5 mpg and approximately normally
distributed. A consumer group conducts its own tests on a simple random sample
of 12 cars of this model and finds that the mean gas mileage for their vehicles is
31.6 mpg with a standard deviation of 3.4 mpg

a.) Perform a test to determine if these data support the contention that the true
mean gas mileage of this model of car is different from the published value
    A: 1. Check assumptions: Nomality is stated and population standard deviation is unknown
       2. H0 : µ = 33.5 v.s. Ha : µ ̸= 33.5
       3. Test statistic = x¯ − µ0 / s/√n = 31.6 − 33.5 /3.4/ √12 = −1.9358
       4. p-value = P(T > |T.S.| or T < −|T.S.| | T ∼ t(n − 1)) = P(T > 1.9358 or T < −1.9358 | T ∼ t(11)) =
          2 × P(T < −1.9358 | T ∼ t(11)) = 2*pt(-1.9358, 11)=0.07900382 > 0.05. Decision: Since the
          p-value is greater than 0.05 (default value), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
       5. Conclusion: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean gas mileage of the model of car is
          different from 33.5
b.) Perform a test to determine if these data support the contention that the true
mean gas mileage of this model of car is less than the published value
   A:  1. Check assumptions: Nomality is stated and population standard deviation is unknown
       2. H0 : µ = 33.5 v.s. Ha : µ < 33.55
       3. Test statistic = x¯ − µ0 / s/√n = 31.6 − 33.5 /3.4/√12 = −1.9358
       4. p-value = P(T < T.S. | T ∼ t(n−1)) = P(T < −1.9358 | T ∼ t(11)) = pt(-1.9358, 11)=0.03950191 < 0.05.
          Decision: Since the p-value is less than 0.05 (default value), we reject the null hypothesis
       5. Conclusion: There is enough evidence to conclude that the mean gas mileage of the model of car is
          significantly less than 33.5.
          
Q: It has been determined that the amount of time that videotapes are
returned late to a certain rental store is modeled by a uniform distribution from
0 to 4 days. Answer each question showing a figure and your work.

a.) What is the probability that a randomly selected videotape will be returned
between 3 and 4 days late?
   A: P(3 < X < 4) = (4 − 3) × 1/4 = 0.25. 
b.) What is the probability that a randomly selected videotape will be returned
more than 1 day late?
   A: P(X > 1) = (4 − 1) × 1/4 = 0.75.

a.) Calculate the line of best fit that predicts the GPA on the basis of IT scores.
   A: GPA  = −0.9644 + 0.0105 × IT
      it = c(295, 152, 214, 171, 131, 178, 225, 141, 116, 173,
               230, 195, 174, 177, 210, 236, 198, 217, 143, 186)
      gpa = c(2.4, 0.6, 0.2, 0, 1, 0.6, 1, 0.4, 0, 2.6,
      2.6, 0, 1.8, 0, 0.4, 1.8, 0.8, 1, 0.2, 2.8)
      reg1 = lm(gpa~it)
      summary(reg1)
b.) Calculate the line of best fit that predicts the GPA on the basis of RR scores.
   A: GPA  = 0.5743 + 0.0137 × RR
   rr = c(41, 18, 45, 29, 28, 38, 25, 26, 22, 37,
            39, 38, 24, 32, 26, 29, 34, 38, 40, 27)
   gpa = c(2.4, 0.6, 0.2, 0, 1, 0.6, 1, 0.4, 0, 2.6,
            2.6, 0, 1.8, 0, 0.4, 1.8, 0.8, 1, 0.2, 2.8)
   reg2 = lm(gpa~rr)
   summary(reg2)
c.) Which of the two lines calculated in parts a and b best fits the data?
   A: The regression line in part a has larger R2 (0.2082) than the regression line in part b (0.01087). This
      indicates better fitting for part a
      
Q: A manufacturer claims that its quality control is so effective that no more
than 2% of the parts in each shipment are defective. A simple random sample of
100 parts from the last shipment contained 3 defectives.

a.) Why is a hypothesis test to determine the validity of the company’s claim
inappropriate? Explain your answer.
   A: Because np0 = 100 × 0.02 = 2 < 10 (p0 = 0.02), one of the assumptions of one-sample z-test for
population proportion is not valid. Therefore, a hypothesis test to determine the validity of the company’s
claim is inappropriate.
b.) What is the smallest sample size for which a test of the claim would be
appropriate at a significance level of 0.05? Show your work.
   A: We need both np0 ≥ 10 and n(1 − p0) ≥ 10. So n ≥ 500 and n ≥ 10.2. Therefore, the smallest
sample size is n = 500.

Q: A researcher claims that 90% of people trust DNA testing. In a survey of
100 people, 91 of them said that they trusted DNA testing. Test the researcher’s
claim at the 1% level of significance.

A: Sample size n = 100 and sample proportion pˆ = 91/100 = 0.91.
   1. Check assumptions: np0 = 90 ≥ 10 and n(1 − p0) = 10 ≥ 10 (p0 = 0.9).
   2. H0 : p = 0.9 v.s. Ha : p ̸= 0.9
   3. Rejection region: {T.S. < −C.V. or T.S. > C.V.}, i.e., to the left or right of the critical value. This is an
      one-sample proportion z-test with significance level α = 0.01. C.V. = -qnorm(α/2) = -qnorm(0.005)
      = 2.575829. The rejection region is {T.S. < −2.576 or T.S. > 2.576}.
   4. Test statistic = pˆ− p0 / sqrt(p0(1−p0)/n) = 0.91 − 0.9/ sqrt(0.9(1−0.9)/100) = 0.3333
   5. p-value = P(Z < −|T.S.| or Z > |T.S.| | Z ∼ N(0, 1)) = P(Z < −0.3333 or Z > 0.3333 | Z ∼
      N(0, 1)) = 2*pnorm(-0.3333)=0.7389078 > 0.01 = α. Decision: Since the p-value is greater than 0.01,
      we fail to reject the null hypothesis
   6. There is no significant evidence that the percentage of people trust DNA testing is different
      from 90%

Q: The dean of students of a large community college claims that the
average distance that commuting students travel to the campus is 32 miles.
The commuting students feel otherwise. A sample of 64 students was randomly
selected and yielded a mean of 35 miles and a standard deviation of 5 miles. Test
the dean’s claim at the 5% level

A: 1. Check assumptions: n = 64 ≥ 30 (normality) and population standard deviation is unknown.
   2. H0 : µ = 32 v.s. Ha : µ ̸= 32
   3. Rejection region: {T.S. < −C.V. or T.S. > C.V.}, i.e., to the left or right of the critical value. This
      is an one-sample t-test with significance level α = 0.05. C.V. = -qt(α/2,n-1) = -qt(0.025, 63) =
      1.998341. The rejection region is {T.S. < −1.998 or T.S. > 1.998}.
   4. Test statistic = x¯ − µ0 / s/√n = 35 − 32 / 5/√64 = 4.8 > 1.998 = C.V.
      Test statistic is in the rejection region, we reject H0.
   5. p-value = P(T > |T.S.| or T < −|T.S.| | T ∼ t(n − 1)) = P(T > 4.8 or T < −4.8 | T ∼ t(63)) =
      2 × P(T < −4.8 | T ∼ t(63)) = 2*pt(-4.8, 63) ≈ 0 < 0.05 = α. Decision: Since the p-value is less
      than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
   6. Conclusion: There is extremely strong evidence to conclude that the average distance that commuting
      students travel to the campus is different from 32 miles

Q: Find the z-score that corresponds to the given area under the standard
normal curve. P(Z ≤ c) = 0.6628

30th percentile. P(Z ≤ c) = 0.3.

A: qnorm(0.3)

Q: In an opinion poll, 25% of 200 people sampled said they were strongly
opposed to the state lottery. The standard error of the sample proportion is
approximately what?

A: pˆ = 0.25, n = 200, SE(ˆp) ≈ sqrt(pˆ(1−pˆ)/n) = sqrt(0.25×(1−0.25)/200) = 0.0306.

Q: What is the critical value t* which satisfies the condition that the t
distribution with 8 degrees of freedom has probability 0.10 to the right of t*?

A: qt(1-0.1,8)

Q: The one-sample t statistic for a test of H0 : µ = 10 v.s. Ha : µ < 10 based
on n = 10 observations has the value t = −2.25. What is the p-value for this test?

A: pt(-2.25,9)

Q: Suppose that prior to conducting a coin-flipping experiment, we suspect
that the coin is fair. How many times would we have to flip the coin in order to
obtain a 95% confidence interval of width of at most 0.05 for the probability of
flipping a head?

A: 0.5*(1-0.5)*(qnorm(1.95/2)/0.025)ˆ2 at least 1537

Q: The guidance office of a school wants to test the claim of an SAT test
preparation company that students who complete their course will improve
their SAT Math score. Ten members of the junior class who have had no SAT
preparation but have taken the SAT once were selected at random and agreed
to participate in the study. All took the course and re-took the SAT at the
next opportunity. The results of the testing indicated the values below. Is there
significant evidence to support the claim that there is an improvement in the
SAT scores after the test prep course?
Student 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Before 475 512 492 465 523 560 610 477 501 420
After 500 540 512 530 533 603 691 512 489 458

A: 1. Since the SAT scores of before and after are from the same students, we need to use matched pairs t-test.
   2. H0 : µd = 0 v.s. Ha : µd > 0
      Since we are interested in if there is an improvement in the SAT scores after the test prep course.
   3. x¯d = 33.3, sd = 26.39, nd = 10. Test statistic = x¯d − 0 sd/√n = 33.3 / 26.39/√10 = 3.99
   4. p-value = P(T > T.S. | T ∼ t(nd − 1) = P(T > 3.99 | T ∼ t(9)) = 1-pt(3.99, 9)=0.001578866
      < 0.05. Decision: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
   5. Conclusion: There is very strong evidence that there is an improvement in the SAT scores after the test
      prep course
      
Q: Suppose that in a large metropolitan area, 90% of all households have a
microwave oven. Consider selecting groups of six households, and let X be the
number of households in a group that have microwave oven

a.) Verify that this is a binomial distribution.
   A: The number of trials is n = 6, The probability of success for each trial is p = 0.9.
      All trials are mutually independent, X ∼ Binomial(n = 6, p = 0.9).
b.) For what proportion of groups will exactly four of the six households have a
microwave oven?
   A: dbinom(4,6,0.9)
c.) For what proportion of groups will at most two of the households have a
microwave oven?
   A: pbinom(2,6,0.9)
d.) What is the proportion of groups for which at least five of the six households
have a microwave oven?
   A: 1-pbinom(4,6,0.9)

Q: Samples of head breadths were obtained by measuring skulls of Egyptian
males from three different epochs, and the measurements are listed below (based
on data from Ancient Races of the Tebaid, by Thomas and Randall-Maciver).
Changes in head shape over time suggest that interbreeding occurred with
immigrant populations. Test the claim that the different epochs do not all have
the same mean head breadth. The analysis of the data was run and the output
is shown below:

Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
epoch 2 138.74 69.37 4.05 0.0305
Residuals 24 411.11 17.13

A: H0: Head breadths from three epochs are the same.
   Ha: Head breadths from three epochs are not the same.
   The p-value of this test is 0.0305 < 0.05, so we reject H0 at 5% significant level. We have strong evidence
   that head breadths from three epochs are not the same.

Q: The weight of bolts produced by a machine has standard deviation of 0.03
pounds. Assuming that the distribution is normal, how large a sample is needed
to determine with a precision of ±0.005 pounds the mean weight of the produced
bolts to 90% confidence?

A: (qnorm(1.9/2)*0.03/0.005)ˆ2

Q: The president of an all-female school stated in an interview that she
was sure that the students at her school studied more, on average, than the
students at a neighboring all-male school. The president of the all-male school
responded that he thought the mean study time for each student body was
undoubtedly about the same and suggested that a study be undertaken to clear
up the controversy. Accordingly, independent samples were taken at the two
schools with the following results:

    School Sample Size Mean Study Time (hrs) Standard deviation (hrs)
   All Female 65 18.56 4.35
   All Male 75 17.95 4.87
   
Determine, at the 2% level of significance, if there is a significant difference
between the mean studying times of the students in the two schools based on
these samples.

A: 1. Check assumptions: Both sample sizes for female and male are larger than 30.
   2. H0 : µf = µm v.s. Ha : µf ̸= µm
   3. x¯f = 18.56, sf = 4.35, nf = 65, x¯m = 17.95, sm = 4.87, nm = 75.
      Test statistic = 18.56 − 17.95 / sqrt(4.352^2/65 + 4.872^2/75) = 0.782733.
      Degrees of freedom = min(nf − 1, nm − 1) = min(65 − 1, 75 − 1) = 64.
   4. p-value = P(T > |T.S.| or T < −|T.S.| | T ∼ t(min(nf − 1, nm − 1))) = P(T > 0.782733 or T <
      −0.782733 | T ∼ t(64)) = 2*pt(-0.782733, 64) = 0.4366706 > 0.02. Decision: Since the p-value is
      greater than 0.02, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
   5. Conclusion: There is no significant evidence that the mean studying times of the students in the two
      schools are different.

Q: A study was conducted to determine whether remediation in basic
mathematics enabled students to be more successful in an elementary statistics
course. (Success here means C or better.) Here are the results of the study
            Remedial   Non-remedial
Sample size   100       40
# of success   70       16

Test, at the 5% level, whether the remediation helped the students to be more
successful.

A: 1. Check assumptions: nrpˆr = 70 > 10, nr(1 − pˆr) = 30 > 10, nnpˆn = 16 > 10, nn(1 − pˆn) = 24 > 10.
2. H0 : pr = pn v.s. Ha : pr > pn
3. pˆr = 70/100 = 0.7, nr = 100, pˆn = 16/40 = 0.4, nn = 40.
Test statistic = 0.7 − 0.4 /sqrt(0.7×(1−0.7)/100 + 0.4×(1−0.4)/40) = 3.33333.
4. p-value = P(Z > T.S.| | Z ∼ N(0, 1)) = P(T > 3.33333 | Z ∼ N(0, 1)) = 1-pnorm(3.33333)
   = 0.0004290655 < 0.05. Decision: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
5. Conclusion: There is extremely strong evidence that the remediation helped the students to be more
successful.

Q: A national computer retailer believes that the average sales are greater for salespersons with a college degree. A random sample of 32 salespersons with a degree had an average weekly sale of $ 3422 last year, while 33 salespersons without a college degree averaged $ 3366 in weekly sales. The standard deviations were $ 468 and $ 642 respectively. Is there evidence at the 5% level to support the retailer's belief?
Select the [p-value, Decision to Reject (RH0) or Failure to Reject (FRH0)].

A: 
sample_with_degree <- c(3422, 3366)
n_with_degree <- c(32, 33)
std_dev_with_degree <- c(468, 642)
pooled_std_dev <- sqrt(((std_dev_with_degree[1]^2 * (n_with_degree[1] - 1)) + (std_dev_with_degree[2]^2 * (n_with_degree[2] - 1))) / (n_with_degree[1] + n_with_degree[2] - 2))
t_stat <- (mean(sample_with_degree[1]) - mean(sample_with_degree[2])) / (pooled_std_dev * sqrt((1/n_with_degree[1]) + (1/n_with_degree[2])))
df <- n_with_degree[1] + n_with_degree[2] - 2
p_value <- 2 * pt(abs(t_stat), df = df)

Q: The decline of salmon fisheries along the Columbia River in Oregon has caused great concern among commercial and recreational fishermen. The paper 'Feeding of Predaceous Fishes on Out-Migrating Juvenile Salmonids in John Day Reservoir, Columbia River' (Trans. Amer. Fisheries Soc. (1991: 405-420) gave the accompanying data on y = maximum size of salmonids consumed by a northern squaw fish (the most abundant salmonid predator) and x = squawfish length, both in mm. Here is the computer software printout of the summary:

Coefficients:  	   	   	   	   
   	  Estimate  	  Std. Error  	  t value  	  Pr(> |t|)  
(Intercept)	  −89.010  	  16.703  	  −5.329  	  0.000  
Length	  0.705  	  0.046  	  15.293  	  0.000  

Using this information, give the equation of the least squares regression line and the 95% confidence interval for the slope

A: 
Intercept (b₀) = -89.010
Slope (b₁) = 0.705
So, the equation of the least squares regression line is:
ŷ = -89.010 + 0.705x

Q: An experimenter flips a coin 100 times and gets 34 heads. Test the claim that the coin is fair against the two-sided claim that it is not fair at the level α=.01.

A: 
n <- 100
x <- 34
alpha <- 0.01
p_hat <- x / n
se <- sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 / n)
z <- (p_hat - 0.5) / se
critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)
p_value <- 2 * pnorm(-abs(z))
cat("Test Statistic (z):", round(z, 2), "\n")
cat("Critical Value:", round(critical_value, 2), "\n")
cat("P-Value:", p_value, "\n")
if (abs(z) > critical_value) {
  cat("Reject Ho at the", alpha * 100, "percent significance level.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject Ho at the", alpha * 100, "percent significance level.\n")
}

Q: State the type of hypothesis test to be used in the following situation:

In a certain city, there are about one million eligible voters. A simple random sample of size 10,000 was chosen to study the relationship between gender and participation in the last election. The results were:
   	                         Men  	  Women  
  Voted  	         2792            3591
  Didn't Vote  	1486            2131
