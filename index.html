Question:
Suppose that the length X of the life (in years) of a battery for a computer has a distribution that can be described by the pdf:

f(x) = 16x / 49 * e^(-8x^2/49)

Determine the probability that the battery fails before the one year warranty expires on the computer.

Answer:
# Define the probability density function (pdf)
pdf <- function(x) {
  return ((16 * x / 49) * exp(-8 * x^2 / 49))
}

# Set the integration bounds
lower_bound <- 0
upper_bound <- 1

# Calculate the probability using the trapezoidal rule (you can also use other methods)
probability <- integrate(pdf, lower_bound, upper_bound)$value

# Print the result
cat("The probability that the battery fails before the one-year warranty expires is:", round(probability, 4), "\n")

Question:
Let X be the amount of time (in hours) the wait is to get a table at a restaurant. Suppose the cdf is represented by

F(x)= 0 if x < 0
F(x)= (x^2)/9 if 0<= x <= 3
F(x)= 1 if x > 3

Use the cdf to determine P(0.5 ≤ X ≤ 1.75)

    # Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of an exponential distribution

Question:
Which of the following statements is not true?

The mean of the sampling distribution of sample mean is always the same as that of X, the distribution from which the sample is taken.


The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample mean = σ/√n


The sampling distribution of sample mean is approximately normal, mound-shaped, and symmetric for n > 30 or n = 30.


The larger the sample size, the better will be the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of sample mean.


(FALSE) The sampling distribution of the sample mean is always reasonably like the distribution of X, the distribution from which the sample is taken.

Question:
Mars Inc. claims that they produce M&Ms with the following distributions:

  Brown  	  30%  	  Red  	  20%  	  Yellow  	  20%  
  Orange  	  10%  	  Green  	  10%  	  Blue  	  10%

Question:
An experimenter is interested in the hypothesis testing problem with H0 : µ = 420 versus
Ha : µ ̸= 420, where µ is the average radiation level in a research laboratory. Suppose that a
sample of 49 radiation level measurements is obtained and that the experimenter wishes to use
σ = 10.0 for the standard deviation of the radiation levels.

Answer:
(a) What type of hypothesis testing is this? Left-tailed? Right-tailed? Or two-tailed?
Ha : µ ̸= 420, this is a two-tailed test.
(b) What is the rejection region when α = 0.01?
The rejection region is T.S. > -qnorm(α/2) = -qnorm(0.005) = 2.5758 or T.S. < qnorm(α/2) = qnorm(0.005) = −2.5758.
(c) Suppose that the sample mean is 415.7. What would be the experimenter’s decision of the
hypothesis test based on the rejection region?
x¯ = 415.7, n = 49, σ = 10. T.S. = x¯−µ0 / σ/√n.  Test Statistic is in the rejection region. We reject the null hypothesis.
(d) What is the p-value for this hypothesis test?
p-value is P(Z > |T.S.| or Z < −|T.S.|) = P(Z > |T.S.|) + P(Z < −|T.S.|) = 2P(Z < −|T.S.|) = 2P(Z <
−3.01) = 2*pnorm(-3.01) = 0.002612477.

Question:
Water samples are taken from water used for cooling as it is being discharged from a power plant
into a river. It has been determined that as long as the mean temperature of the discharged
water is atbmost 150 F, there will be no negative effects on the river’s ecosystem. To investigate
whether the plant is in compliance with regulations that prohibit a mean discharge-water
temperature above 150 F, 50 water sample will be tank at randomly selected times, and the
temperature of each sample will be recorded.

Answer:
(a) Determine an appropriate null and alternative hypothesis for this test.
H0 : µ = 150 v.s. Ha : µ > 150
(b) In the context of this situation, describe type I and type II errors.
Type I error: if it is determined that the mean discharge-water temperature is above 150 F, when it is not
greater than 150 F.

Question:
For each of the following scenarios, state whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or
not. State any assumptions that you make beyond the information that is given.

Answer:
(a) H0 : µ = 6, Ha : µ ̸= 6, n = 25, x¯ = 5.6, s = 2.5, α = 0.05
1. We should assume the population is normally distributed because the sample size is less than 30.
3. p-value: P(T > |T.S.| or T < −|T.S.| | T ∼ t(n − 1)) = 2P(T < −0.8 | T ∼ t(24)) = 2*pt(-0.8,24) =
0.4315585 > α = 0.05
4. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
(b) H0 : µ = 6, Ha : µ < 6, n = 25, x¯ = 5.6, s = 2.5, α = 0.05
1. We should assume the population is normally distributed because the sample size is less than 30.
3. p-value: P(T < T.S. | T ∼ t(n − 1)) = P(T < −0.8 | T ∼ t(24)) = pt(-0.8,24) = 0.2157793 > α
4. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
(c) H0 : µ = 25, Ha : µ > 25, n = 81, x¯ = 26.4, s = 3.2, α = 0.01
1. Sample size is larger than 30, so we can apply Central Limit Theorem and use the normal distribution
approximately.
3. p-value: P(T > T.S. | T ∼ t(n − 1)) = P(T > 3.9375 | T ∼ t(80)) = 1 − P(T ≤ 3.9375 | T ∼ t(80)) =
1-pt(3.9375,80) ≈ 0 < α = 0.05
4. We reject the null hypothesis.
(d) H0 : µ = 50, Ha : µ ̸= 50, n = 55, p-value = 0.053
If we assume α = 0.05, p-value = 0.053 > α, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis
