Question:
Suppose that the length X of the life (in years) of a battery for a computer has a distribution that can be described by the pdf:

f(x) = 16x / 49 * e^(-8x^2/49)

Determine the probability that the battery fails before the one year warranty expires on the computer.

Answer:
# Define the probability density function (pdf)
pdf <- function(x) {
  return ((16 * x / 49) * exp(-8 * x^2 / 49))
}

# Set the integration bounds
lower_bound <- 0
upper_bound <- 1

# Calculate the probability using the trapezoidal rule (you can also use other methods)
probability <- integrate(pdf, lower_bound, upper_bound)$value

# Print the result
cat("The probability that the battery fails before the one-year warranty expires is:", round(probability, 4), "\n")

Question:
Let X be the amount of time (in hours) the wait is to get a table at a restaurant. Suppose the cdf is represented by

F(x)= 0 if x < 0
F(x)= (x^2)/9 if 0<= x <= 3
F(x)= 1 if x > 3

Use the cdf to determine P(0.5 ≤ X ≤ 1.75)

Answer:
cdf <- function(x) {
    if (x < 0) {
      return(0)
    } else if (0 <= x && x <= 3) {
      return(x^2 / 9)
    } else {
      return(1)
    }
  }
  
  # Calculate P(0.5 <= X <= 1.75)
  a <- 0.5
  b <- 1.75
  
  probability <- cdf(b) - cdf(a)
  
  cat(sprintf("P(%s <= X <= %s) = %s\n", a, b, probability))

Question:
Suppose the time a child spends waiting at for the bus as a school bus stop is exponentially distributed with mean 5 minutes. 
Determine the probability that the child must wait at least 8 minutes on the bus on a given morning

Answer:
exponential_cdf <- function(x, mean) {
    # Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of an exponential distribution
    if (x < 0) {
      return(0)
    } else {
      lambd <- 1 / mean
      return(1 - exp(-lambd * x))
    }
  }
  
  # Set the mean of the exponential distribution
  mean_wait_time <- 5
  
  # Set the time threshold (8 minutes in this case)
  wait_threshold <- 8
  
  # Calculate the probability of waiting at least 8 minutes
  probability <- 1 - exponential_cdf(wait_threshold, mean_wait_time)
  
  cat(sprintf("The probability of waiting at least %d minutes is: %.4f\n", wait_threshold, probability))

Question:
Costs for standard veterinary services at a local animal hospital follow a Normal distribution with a mean of $ 79 and a standard deviation 
of $ 20. What is the probability that one bill for veterinary services costs less than $ 103?

Answer:
# Given values
mean <- 79
std_dev <- 20
bill_amount <- 103

# Calculate the probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
probability_less_than_103 <- pnorm(bill_amount, mean = mean, sd = std_dev)

cat("The probability that a bill is less than $103 is:", format(probability_less_than_103, digits = 4), "\n")

Question:

cat("The value of c is:", c, "\n")

Question:
Which of the following statements is not true?

The mean of the sampling distribution of sample mean is always the same as that of X, the distribution from which the sample is taken.


The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample mean = σ/√n


The sampling distribution of sample mean is approximately normal, mound-shaped, and symmetric for n > 30 or n = 30.


The larger the sample size, the better will be the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of sample mean.


(FALSE) The sampling distribution of the sample mean is always reasonably like the distribution of X, the distribution from which the sample is taken.

Answer:
# Given data
sample_mean <- 5.5  # average height
sample_std <- 0.1  # standard deviation

Question:
Let x represent the hemoglobin count (HC) in grams per 100 milliliters of whole blood. The distribution for HC is 
approximately normal with μ = 14 for healthy adult women. Suppose that a female patient has taken 12 laboratory blood 
samples in the last year. The HC data sent to her doctor is listed below. We would like to know if the data indicates this patient 
has significantly high HC compared to the population.
17,21,19,20,21,22,17,14,14,16,20,22
Give the p-value and interpret the results.

Answer:
# Given data
hc_data <- c(17, 21, 19, 20, 21, 22, 17, 14, 14, 16, 20, 22)

# Population mean
mu <- 14

# Perform one-sample t-test
result <- t.test(hc_data, mu = mu)

# Output results
cat("T-statistic:", result$statistic, "\n")
cat("P-value:", result$p.value, "\n")

# Interpret the results
alpha <- 0.05  # significance level

if (result$p.value < alpha) {
  cat("The p-value is less than the significance level.\n")
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence that the patient has significantly high HC.\n")
} else {
  cat("The p-value is greater than the significance level.\n")
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant evidence of high HC in the patient.\n")
}

Question:
A simple random sample of 81 8th graders at a large suburban middle school indicated that 87% of them are involved 
with some type of after school activity. Find the 90% confidence interval that estimates the proportion of them that are 
involved in an after school activity.

Answer:
# Given values
sample_proportion <- 0.87
confidence_level <- 0.90
sample_size <- 81

# Calculate standard error
standard_error <- sqrt((sample_proportion * (1 - sample_proportion)) / sample_size)

# Calculate Z-score for the given confidence level
z_score <- qnorm((1 + confidence_level) / 2)

# Calculate margin of error
margin_of_error <- z_score * standard_error

# Calculate confidence interval
lower_bound <- sample_proportion - margin_of_error
upper_bound <- sample_proportion + margin_of_error

# Print the results
cat("Confidence Interval: (", round(lower_bound, 4), ",", round(upper_bound, 4), ")\n")

Question:
Mars Inc. claims that they produce M&Ms with the following distributions:

  Brown  	  30%  	  Red  	  20%  	  Yellow  	  20%  
  Orange  	  10%  	  Green  	  10%  	  Blue  	  10%  

How many M&Ms must be sampled to construct the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of blue 
M&Ms in that bag if we want a margin of error of ± .14? (note that the z-score was rounded to three decimal places in the calculation)

Answer:
# Given values
confidence_level <- 0.95
margin_of_error <- 0.14
estimated_proportion <- 0.10  # 10% for blue M&Ms

# Calculate the z-score based on the desired confidence level
z_score <- round(qnorm((1 + confidence_level) / 2), 3)

# Calculate the required sample size using the formula
sample_size <- ceiling((z_score^2 * estimated_proportion * (1 - estimated_proportion)) / margin_of_error^2)

cat("Required sample size:", sample_size, "\n")

Answer:
# Mean and standard deviation
mean <- 30
std_dev <- 9

# Value for which we want to find the probability
x <- 42.15

# Calculate the z-score
z_score <- (x - mean) / std_dev

# Find the probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
probability <- 1 - pnorm(z_score)

distribution of the contents has a mean of 32 ounces and a standard deviation of .32 ounce. What is the probability that the mean contents 
of the 400 sample cans is less than 31.984 ounces?

Answer:
# Given values
mean_population <- 32  # mean of the population
std_dev_population <- 0.32  # standard deviation of the population
sample_size <- 400  # size of the sample
mean_sample <- 31.984  # mean of the sample

# Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM)
sem <- std_dev_population / sqrt(sample_size)

# Calculate the Z-score
z_score <- (mean_sample - mean_population) / sem

# Find the probability using the cumulative distribution function (pnorm)

Question:
An experimenter flips a coin 100 times and gets 34 heads. Test the claim that the coin is fair against the 
two-sided claim that it is not fair at the level α=.01.

Answer:
# Given data
n <- 100  # Number of coin flips
x <- 34   # Number of heads
p_0 <- 0.5  # Null hypothesis proportion

# Calculate sample proportion
p_hat <- x / n

# Calculate standard error
se <- sqrt(p_0 * (1 - p_0) / n)

# Calculate z-score
z <- (p_hat - p_0) / se

# Set significance level
alpha <- 0.01

# Calculate critical z-values for a two-tailed test
z_critical <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)

# Compare the absolute value of z-score with critical z-value
if (abs(z) > z_critical) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis\n")
}

# Print the calculated z-score and critical z-value
cat("z-score:", z, "\n")
